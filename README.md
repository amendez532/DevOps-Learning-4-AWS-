# DevOps-Learning-4-AWS-
This project automates the deployment of a Node.js application on AWS using a full DevOps workflow. It creates the cloud infrastructure (VPC, subnets, and EKS cluster) with Terraform, builds and pushes Docker images via Jenkins, deploys to Kubernetes (EKS), and monitors the system with Prometheus and Grafana.
