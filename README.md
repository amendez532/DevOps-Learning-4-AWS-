# 🛠️ DevOps AWS Project

This project automates the deployment of a containerized Node.js application on AWS using a complete DevOps workflow. It provisions infrastructure with Terraform (VPC, subnets, EKS cluster), builds and pushes Docker images through Jenkins, deploys them to Kubernetes (EKS), and enables monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana.

## 🔧 Tools Used

- **Terraform** – Infrastructure as Code (AWS VPC + EKS)
- **AWS** – Cloud provider (EC2, EKS, IAM)
- **Jenkins** – CI/CD pipeline automation
- **Docker** – Application containerization
- **Kubernetes (EKS)** – Container orchestration
- **Prometheus & Grafana** – Monitoring and visualization

## 🎯 Goals

- Automate cloud infrastructure provisioning
- Implement CI/CD with Jenkins and EKS
- Monitor cluster and app performance with Grafana
